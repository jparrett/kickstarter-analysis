# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project will provide additional information to the Playwrite Louise to help to continue her crowdfunding success.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze how different campains fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.   Specifically, looking at campains with a theater focus by month and campains with a play subcategory by range of funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
When looking specifically at the theater group, the most successful campains had launch dates in May and June.   With May having 111 successful campaigns (or 66.9%) and June following with 100 successful campaigns (or 65.4%).   

The least successful launch dates were in December and November.   With December having 35 failed campaigns (or 46.7%) and November following with 50 failed campaigns (or 43.5%).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of the outcomes based on goals was performed specifically on the play subcategory.   When breaking down the project goals there is a clear trend that as the goal increases the percentage of positive projects decreases.    For example, projects less than 1,000 returned a success rate of 76% while projects between 5,000 and 9,999 only had a success rate of 55%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The highest success rate tends to ramp up starting in April, peaking in May and slowly declining over the next two month.   To have the most success, Louise should launch her project during May.

The lowest success rates tend to be at the end of the calendar year.   Louise should avoid launching her project at this time.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the data compiled, Louise would have the greatest posibility of success by keeping her goal at 4,999 or less.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

When limiting the data to plays, the number of data points decreased significantly once the goal was above 25,000.   Looking at the 40,000-44,999 range presents as very successful with a 67% success rate.   This is not a good measure since there were only 4 projects, versus the 141 projects in the less than 1,000 range.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

When looking at the outcomes based on launch date, another table that would be helpful would be to see the percentage of successful and failed projects.   There is a variance in the number of projects listed by month and the percentage would be able to be used with the current graph to ensure this is not skewing the results.
